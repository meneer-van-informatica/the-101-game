# AI Policy  The 101 Game

**We only ship AI-written code.** Rationale: copyright clarity, speed, and a consistent prompt  paste workflow.

## Rules
1. All source files must start with an **AI-Generated** header including:
   - Model name (e.g., GPT-5 Thinking)
   - Date
   - Short prompt summary
   - License note (MIT, per repo)
2. No manually authored code in PRs. Documentation may be human-authored.
3. Keep prompts short in headers; never include secrets or private data.
4. If you refactor, generate the refactor via AI and update the header.

## Why (Informatics × Economics × Art)
- **Informatics**: reproducible prompts, clean provenance.
- **Economics**: faster iteration, lower integration cost.
- **Art**: compositional design by prompting; every level teaches one idea.
